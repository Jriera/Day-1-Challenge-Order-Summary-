## My process
Beginning with the main component and structure in HTML and polish the styles section to section afterwards to define the styles

### Built with

- CSS Grid


### What I learned

This was a quick practice to show that HTML and CSS still can accomplish fine results and offer a quick and lightweight developement with good visuals and performance



### Continued development

It is possible that I integrate this challenge in other challenges down the road and create an interactive flow between different elements
